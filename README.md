Hi,

This is a Matlab code that I wrote to fit single spectrum to multiple gaussians in order to map 3D spectral
imaging, kind of image, consisting of spectrum at each pixel to 2D image through replacing spectrum with corresponding any
selected gaussian area.

This code was written as a part of data processing of EELS (Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy) mapping purposes. 

Please feel free to contact me for any improvement, questions or anything. Thank you.
